Coding Challenge program:

I opted to do Coding challenge #2.

Language: Python

Before Using: the ip's must be hardcoded as requested in the challenge.

The format is as such ip1 is the machine that runs the server side of the program. Choose any machine of the three, but the ip1 in the client MUST match the ip1 of the server.

WARNING: 
  Again, in big bold letters, make sure when you hard code the ip's of the machines you're using ip1 in client.py is the same ip as ip1 in server.py
