# Coding Challenge program:

Challenge #:1
  The solution to challendge 1 is in file "q1.c"

Challenge #: 2

  The solution to challenge 2 is in the files "server.py" and "client.py"
  
Solution Language: Python
Solution: server.py & client.py

__Before Using:__ the ip's must be hardcoded as was requested in the interview challenge.

The format ought to be as such: 
(Server.py)
ip1 = the process that runs the server side of the program. 
ip2 = A process that will run client.py
ip3 = A process that will run client.py

Note: "ip1" in client.py ____MUST____ match "ip1" server.py

# WARNING: 
  Again, in big bold letters, make sure when you hard code the ip's of the machines you're using ip1 in client.py is the same ip as ip1 in server.py




# Log: 
This is the second git repo I created to display my solutions. The original repository on was on Cornell's private github page so I copied it over here. Here is the original github log so you can see the course of development.

    this is the first full solution to question #2, This solutions was generated by parring down a simple socket chat program tutorial, this took about an hour of company time to produce. Problems: this solution doesn't scale (i.e. what iff the company wanted 20,000 computers to work together instea of 3), it doesn't preserve order (not requested but maintaining order as an invariance might be helpful in the future). Since the basic requirements have been met I will be moving onto the personal writing section. Will return to optimize and streamline into a superior solution if it is deemed prudent under time constraints.
