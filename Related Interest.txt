I want three things from my new occupation. I wish to provide safety security and peace of mind, in a time of turbulence and frequent (if not bi-weekly) security breaches over the news. I want to establish a a modest sum to be invested for the sake of my future children and grand children, and the great grand children whom I shall likely never have the opportunity to see born in my lifetime. I want to develop my skills in the deep underlying intricacies of arcane white hat hacking to truly hone myself as a professional in all things both computer and w̱̄͟e̱̱̿i̅͟͟r̠̳̠ḏ̠͞.
